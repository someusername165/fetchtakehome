### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
Image caching.  Because its annoying.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
5 Hours.  3.5 Hours on networking & caching. 30 min on the swiftui views. 30 min being confused on concurrency
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I didn't add error handling via UI / memory management for the image networking.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Image networking memory management, if we had an infinite list our app would crash at some point.
Also Lists aren't necessarily performative (though you'd assume so given comparison to tableview/stackview), so i'd probably go back to using a tableview if need be.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
It was alot of fun making an app after a long time.  Feel like the biggest constraint was the project details weren't exactly specific.  So I'll leave the project like this.
